"""Diff the board into transitions, so the screen can report change instead of state.

Election-night coverage doesn't re-read the whole tally every thirty seconds. It
says what *moved*. That's the difference between a board you glance at and a
board you stop looking at.

Two disciplines, and both are about not becoming noise:

  Diff, don't report.  A count going 2 → 2 is silence. Only transitions exist
                       here: a thread arrives at your desk, a thread finishes,
                       the alarm flips.

  Aggregate at scale.  At 1000 streams, per-item narration is unusable. Above a
                       threshold the line becomes rates and exceptions —
                       "twelve finished, three need you" — and the individual
                       events stay visual only.

The board is a screen. Movement flashes on the card. Nothing in this module
reaches the speaker — unsolicited UUID readouts ("fee needs you") were the
parrot. Phrase() still returns a human line so a future opt-in has somewhere
safe to start; observe() leaves spoken empty.
