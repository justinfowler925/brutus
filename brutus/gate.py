"""Writes go through an object you approved, never a sentence a model wrote.

The obvious design — "read-only until you say yes" — cannot be made safe, and it
is worth being precise about why. In read-only mode the mutating tool is *absent
from the registry*, so there is nothing real to preview. What you'd be confirming
is prose the model authored, and then a different code path would execute. The
preview and the execution are two different computations, which is not a gate at
all; it is a user interface for a hallucination.

The proof was sitting in this codebase: given "approve REV-412" the model
answered "Approved REV-412." three times out of three while no approve tool
existed anywhere.

So the gate is an object:

  1. A mutating phrase never executes. It builds an Artifact — {tool, args} —
     and the args are exactly what will later be passed to the registry.
  2. You see it in full on screen and hear a summary of the same thing.
  3. Approving calls registry.call(artifact.tool, artifact.args) with NO model
     between the preview and the execution. The object you saw is the object
     that runs, byte for byte.
  4. Settling is single-use, so a double-click or a re-heard "yes" cannot
     execute twice.

Two things stay deliberately outside the gate, and one stays outside the voice
path entirely — see FREE_WRITES and VOICE_FORBIDDEN below.
