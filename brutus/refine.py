"""Turn a raw capture into something workable.

Justin says a paragraph; the queue needs a line. This drafts a title, a one-line
summary and the list of things still missing, then parks the item in `Refining`
for him to confirm. It never promotes its own guess to `Ready` — a summariser
that decides is a summariser you have to audit.

Two invariants, both load-bearing:

**Capture never blocks on this.** The row is written first and refined after. A
dead router, a timeout, a model returning prose instead of JSON — all of them
leave a stored capture with a deterministic title, never a lost one. The pad has
to stay usable in two seconds or it stops getting used, and that matters more
than a pretty title.

**The verbatim text survives.** `raw` is never rewritten. Every draft is
reversible because the thing he actually said is still on the row.
