"""Zoom AI Companion notes → the capture pad.

There is already a Zoom lane into Brutus: `scripts/feed_zoom_to_brutus_notes.py`
polls Salesforce `Meeting_Notes__c`, which the org-wide Apex pipeline fills from
`recording.completed` webhooks. That lane works and this module does not replace
it — it covers the meetings that lane structurally cannot see.

The gap is cloud recording. `Meeting_Notes__c` only ever gets a row when a
meeting was cloud-recorded, and Justin does not cloud-record: `recordings_list`
over a month returns zero. His meetings carry AI Companion output instead, so the
hourly job scans 600+ notes and posts nothing, every hour, correctly. What it is
scanning is other people's recordings where an item happens to name him.

Zoom puts commitments in two places on those meetings, both reachable through
`get_meeting_assets` without any recording:

    my_notes.content_markdown        "## Action Items", one bullet per item,
                                     owner in a bold prefix.
    meeting_summary.summary_markdown "## Next steps", owners as "###" subheads,
                                     every bullet carrying a tasks.zoom.us link.

Both shapes are parsed here, but only one is used per meeting by default — they
are two AI restatements of the same conversation, and blending them duplicated a
third of a real meeting's items. `extract_items` explains why the overlap is
ranked rather than fuzzy-matched away. Items land at stage `Captured` with
`source="zoom"`, which puts them in the Inbox for routing and lets the refine
sweeper draft titles the same way it does for speech.

Three things this module is careful about:

1.  **It never reshapes `todos`.** Bookkeeping lives in its own tables.
    Adding a column to a shared table is what blinded the deployed daemon on
    2026-08-08 (see `Todo.from_row` and `paths.may_migrate_shared_schema`); new
    tables are genuinely additive because no older reader selects from them.

2.  **Zoom's "nothing to report" prose is not a task.** "No action items
    assigned." and "Next steps were not generated due to insufficient
    transcript." arrive as ordinary bullets, so an unfiltered parse invents work
    nobody was assigned.

3.  **Transport is somebody else's problem.** `ingest_assets` takes an
    already-fetched payload, so the same extraction serves a Claude session
    holding the Zoom connector today and an in-process poller if Zoom
    server-to-server credentials ever exist. No Zoom client lives here.
