"""Fan out session events to whoever is watching the screen.

Election-night coverage means results *arrive*. A page that polls shows you a
snapshot on a timer; a page fed by this shows you the moment. Same reason the
deep lane can afford to be slow — you can see it working.

Two properties matter and both are about not hurting the turn:

  Never block.   A slow or dead browser must not stall the conversation, so
                 every queue is bounded and a full one drops its oldest item
                 rather than applying backpressure.

  Never throw.   publish() is called from inside the turn pipeline. A listener
                 that has gone away is normal, not an error.
