"""Laptop watchdog — the local router's health, and nothing else.

This used to be Atlas's fast scheduler. Every ``watchdog_interval_s`` (60s) it
called ``/api/status``, ``/api/reconcile``, ``/api/dispatch/tick`` and
``run_cursor_tick`` against the Studio conductor, which made a laptop lid
load-bearing for a Studio service. That driving moved to
``atlas/conductor/scheduler.py`` in Phase 4 step 4: Atlas runs its own loop in
the process that serves :8767, so it survives the lid.

Two things worth writing down, because the shape of the fix depended on both:

* The Studio was **already** reconciling and dispatching without the laptop —
  its launchd tick logged ~190 records/day for five straight days, overnight
  included. What the lid actually cost was cadence (60s → 900s) and the cursor
  lane. So this was mostly deletion, not migration.
* The reconcile/dispatch calls deleted here had no equivalent that Atlas lacked.
  ``POST /api/reconcile`` is ``reconcile_inflight``; ``POST /api/dispatch/tick``
  is ``dispatch_tick`` — literally the same two functions the Studio tick calls.
  The ``ready > 0`` guard made Brutus do *less*, never more.

What stays is a genuine laptop concern: the local MLX router runs here, so
probing it and restarting it belongs here. Nothing in Atlas depends on this
loop any more — Brutus can be stopped, and Atlas keeps moving.

The cursor runner (``brutus/cursor_runner.py``) is deliberately NOT driven from
here any more and was NOT moved to the Studio in this change — see
``POST /api/cursor/run`` for the manual entry point and the module docstring
for why a shared checkout there is the wrong place for it.
