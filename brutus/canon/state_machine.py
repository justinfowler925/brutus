"""Canonical Work Item state machine + completion-proof enforcement.

Implements the REV-510 spec's state graph and its enforcement rule:

    No state_history entry with state = acceptance or state = closure is
    valid unless its actor is the authenticated accountable human owner.
    A granted Approval records consent for its scoped external action; it
    does not authenticate a worker/agent to finalize Canon state.

This is the load-bearing module for REV-513's acceptance criterion
"No model narration can change canonical completion state without
required evidence and accountable-owner acceptance."
