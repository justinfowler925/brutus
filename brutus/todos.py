"""Justin's work queue — everything he says, turned into something workable.

This is deliberately laptop-local. The Studio ledger is the SSOT for *tracked
work the bots execute*; this is the layer BEFORE that — half-formed thoughts,
reminders, "look into X" — which must be capturable in two seconds without
deciding anything. An item graduates into the real ledger via promote(), which
registers it as a manual thread the conductor then triages like any ticket.

The pipeline is the point. A capture lands verbatim in `raw` and moves:

    Captured -> Refining -> Ready -> Working -> Done

`Captured` is untouched speech. `Refining` means a title and a one-line summary
have been drafted and the open questions listed, but nobody has confirmed them —
a draft is never allowed to masquerade as a decision. `Ready` means there is
enough detail to actually start. `Working` covers in-flight items, blocked or
not; blocked is a flag on the row and a written word on screen, never a stage of
its own and never a colour alone.

Three fields carry the text, because one field could not:

    raw      the verbatim capture, never rewritten — the record of what was said
    text     the short human-facing line (a drafted title once refined)
    summary  one line of what it actually is

Storage is one sqlite file under the state dir (outside every checkout). Losing
it loses nothing the bots were doing — by design, per the invariant that the
laptop never owns the work ledger.
