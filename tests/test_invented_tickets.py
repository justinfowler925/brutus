"""Brutus must not name a ticket that nothing in this turn justifies.

Measured 2026-08-12 with `scripts/model-bakeoff.py`: empty board, one prior
assistant turn reading "REV-401 is waiting on you", Qwen3-8B-4bit answered

    REV-401 is still waiting on you. Approve or reject? Then 2 more.

three runs out of three. Nothing was waiting on him; the "2 more" was invented
whole. Qwen3-14B-4bit answered "Nothing needs you right now." every time, which
is why the regression rode in unnoticed with the drop to the 8B (#65).

The system prompt already forbids this in two separate places. It is not a
control — these tests cover the two mechanisms that are.
