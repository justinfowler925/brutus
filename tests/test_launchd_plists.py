"""A launchd job must run from the deployed artifact, never a shared checkout.

The daemon was moved to ~/.brutus/app because ~/Projects/brutus is a checkout
other sessions switch branches in, and twice in one day the service ended up
running someone else's unmerged branch. Three sibling agents — the tunnel, the
local LLM, and the Zoom notes feeder — were left pointing at the shared repo and
inherited the whole problem quietly.

On 2026-08-09 that checkout sat on a branch 8,625 lines behind main, so every one
of those three had been executing five-month-old scripts on every launch. Nothing
reported an error: the jobs ran, they just ran the wrong code.
