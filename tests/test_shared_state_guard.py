"""Only the deployed artifact may reshape the databases the daemon is serving.

2026-08-08: a feature branch run by hand against ~/.brutus/state added seven
columns to the live `todos` table. Deployed main raised TypeError on every read
from that second on — /api/todos 500, the Ideas pad blank, 181 rows intact and
unreachable. The reader was made forward-compatible the same night; this is the
other half, the one that stops the write.
