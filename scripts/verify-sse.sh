# Verify the session event stream against a REAL uvicorn process.
#
# There is no in-process test for this. An infinite SSE stream driven through
# TestClient or httpx.ASGITransport hangs the suite instead of failing it —
# neither transport can abandon a generator that legitimately never ends.
# Chasing that produced a harness artifact, not a bug, so the stream is proven
# where it actually runs.
#
# What this asserts, in order:
#   1. the stream opens immediately, before anything has happened
#   2. a turn posted afterwards arrives on the open stream
#   3. the frames carry both renderings — full text and the spoken version
#
#   ./scripts/verify-sse.sh          # exit 0 = the stream works
