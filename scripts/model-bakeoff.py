"""Bake-off: score a model on the work Brutus actually asks of it.

Uses Brutus's OWN prompt assembly (`_build_messages`) and its OWN tool-call
parser (`_parse_tool_call`), so a pass here means the real code path would have
worked. A hand-written prompt or a hand-written regex would be measuring
something adjacent and calling it the product.

Scenarios only cover what REACHES the model: `_lookup_intent` force-routes
approve/reject, reconcile, dispatch, digest, steering and capture by regex
before the LLM is consulted, so those prove nothing about a model. Every
scenario below is asserted to fall through that regex first.

SCOPE — read this before filing a bug off a red line here. This harness calls
the model directly. It measures the MODEL, not Brutus. A failure below is a
hypothesis about user impact, not evidence of one: `resolve_chat_reply` sits in
front of all of this and answers gate questions deterministically
(`spoken_next_decision`), retries tool calls, and since #68 strips ticket ids
from Brutus's own prior turns and refuses to emit an id this turn cannot
justify. `gate.stale_history` in particular still fails on Qwen3-8B-4bit and is
expected to — the model really does resurrect the id, and the guard upstream of
this connection point means it never reaches Justin. Confirm any finding by
driving `resolve_chat_reply` before calling it a bug.
