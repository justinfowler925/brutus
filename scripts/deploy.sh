# Deploy Brutus to the dedicated service worktree and restart it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The daemon used to run straight out of ~/Projects/brutus, a shared checkout
# that other sessions switch branches in. Twice in one day it ended up serving a
# different branch than intended — once someone else's unmerged feature branch,
# for half an hour, while a restart reported "up after 2s" and looked perfect.
#
# The service now runs from its own detached worktree at ~/.brutus/app. Nothing
# anyone does in ~/Projects/brutus can change what is running. State lives at
# ~/.brutus/state, outside every checkout, so a redeploy cannot empty it.
#
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh            # deploy origin/main
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh --status   # what is running, and is it current?
