# Re-vendor the shine token layer into brutus/static/shine-tokens.css.
#
# Brutus has no build step, so the tokens are copied in rather than imported.
# The copy's own header has named this script since it was created; the script
# did not exist, which is why the vendored layer sat stale behind shine and the
# type tokens took a second pass to arrive. A documented step nobody can run is
# not a step.
#
# Usage: scripts/sync-shine-tokens.sh [--check]
#   --check  exit 1 if the vendored copy is stale (for CI / shine's doctor)
#
# A plain run builds shine first. Copying dist/ without building copies whatever
# was last built in that checkout, which is the same staleness this script exists
# to remove, one directory over. --check deliberately does not build: it answers
# "is the committed copy current?" and must not change what it is measuring.
